# Data Driven Marketing Optimization: Enhancing Engagement Conversions and Customer Satisfaction

# Introduction 

ShopEasy, a growing online retail business, has been facing challenges with its marketing performance specifically, a noticeable decline in customer engagement and conversion rates despite increased investments in online marketing campaigns. The marketing team observed that while traffic remained relatively stable, user interaction with content and the rate of visitors turning into paying customers had dropped significantly. Additionally, customer feedback suggested areas of dissatisfaction that needed further exploration. This project was initiated to analyze these issues using data-driven methods. By examining marketing performance metrics, customer reviews, social media engagement, and conversion trends, the goal was to uncover insights that could guide strategic improvements. Key focus areas included identifying content types that drive higher engagement, pinpointing drop-off points in the conversion funnel, and understanding recurring themes in customer feedback. This comprehensive marketing analytics case aimed not only to diagnose the problems but also to recommend actionable strategies to enhance ShopEasy’s overall marketing effectiveness.

# Overview

The Marketing Manager at ShopEasy has reported ongoing challenges with the effectiveness of recent marketing campaigns. Despite increased investment, the company has experienced a decline in both customer engagement and conversion rates, leading to a disappointing return on investment. To address this issue, a comprehensive data analysis is requested to evaluate the performance of current marketing strategies and identify areas for improvement. ShopEasy has collected extensive data from multiple sources, including customer reviews, social media interactions, and campaign performance metrics. A thorough analysis of this data is expected to uncover actionable insights that can help optimize marketing efforts and improve overall outcomes.

# Anaysis and Decisions

The primary challenge identified in this project was ShopEasy’s declining customer engagement and conversion rates, despite increased marketing investments. Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on customer behavior, marketing performance, and sentiment data from customer reviews.

Key findings revealed that although the click-through rate stood at a healthy **15.37%**, overall views and interactions steadily declined after mid-year. Conversion rates fluctuated significantly, with a peak in January **(16.5%)** driven by Ski Boots, and a low in October **(6.0%)**, indicating clear seasonal trends and performance gaps. Customer feedback was largely positive **84%** of reviews had positive sentiment—but some products consistently underperformed, receiving ratings below **3.5**.

Based on these insights, **three strategic areas for action were defined**:

Increase Conversion Rates by focusing on high-performing products, leveraging peak seasons with targeted campaigns, and refining the conversion funnel to reduce drop-offs.

Enhance Customer Engagement by revitalizing content strategies, implementing interactive formats, and optimizing calls to action during low-engagement months.

Improve Feedback Scores through structured feedback loops, addressing mixed reviews, and following up with dissatisfied customers to improve brand perception.

These recommendations aim to align ShopEasy’s marketing strategies more closely with customer expectations and behavior.

# Conclusion 

As a data analyst, this project not only deepened my technical skills across tools like PostgreSQL, Python (for sentiment analysis), and Power BI, but also taught me how to transform raw data into business value. It reinforced the importance of contextual storytelling, customer-centric insights, and data-driven decision-making in modern marketing optimization.
